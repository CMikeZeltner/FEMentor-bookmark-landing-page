## My process

### Built with

- SASS


### What I learned

For this project I decided to learn how to use SASS. I'm glad I did, as it made my styling easier and more maintainable. Looking back at my SASS markup, I can feel I came a long way since I started this project. Overall, the styling is a little messy, I missed the chance to make some components that would have reduced my file size, but I'm still glad with how things turned out. Not bad for a first try.

### Continued development

I would like my next project to be full-stack, whether I complete another FrontEndMentor challenge or make something up on my own. I'd like to use SASS again for the project, and maybe jQuery as well. I'm excited to continue learning and I know my next project will be even better than the ones that came before.

### Useful resources
